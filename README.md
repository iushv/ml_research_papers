# 🧠 ML Research Papers

A collection of **from-scratch implementations** of foundational and novel ML/AI research papers, with detailed learning notes and verified experiments.

---

## 📚 Implemented Papers

| Paper | Year | Key Innovation | Status |
|-------|------|----------------|--------|
| [Dropout](papers/dropout/) | 2014 | Regularization via random neuron dropping | ✅ Complete |
| [Forgetting Transformer (FoX)](papers/forgetting_transformer/) | 2025 | O(1) memory attention with forget gates | ✅ 6/6 claims verified |

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. **Implement** research papers from scratch (not just use libraries)
2. **Understand** the math and intuition behind each innovation
3. **Verify** paper claims with reproducible experiments
4. **Document** learnings for the community

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iushv/ml_research_papers.git
cd ml_research_papers

# Pick a paper
cd papers/dropout  # or papers/forgetting_transformer

# Setup environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install torch numpy matplotlib

# Run experiments
python src/experiment.py
```
